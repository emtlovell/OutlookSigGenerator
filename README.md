# OutlookSigGenerator

# Purpose

This was a project from 2018 to Generate and Apply Outlook Signitures for each user.
This program pulls information from Active Directory and preopulates the fields.

# Notes

This program may be slow to load, especially after the outlook confirmation while it attempts to pull from Active Directory.

GUI may appear broken or incomplete, there are many hidden objects that appear when steps are complete.
